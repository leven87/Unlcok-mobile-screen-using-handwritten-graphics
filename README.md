# Unlcok-mobile-screen-using-handwritten-graphics
This is my master's thesis project. It proposes a scheme of unlocking the mobile phone screen using handwritten graphics (signature), including a mobile app and several experiments (datasets and codes). I mainly used a DTW-based algorithm to verify online handwritten graphics. In the experimental part, I tried to use the machine learning classification algorithm to predict the forgery difficulty level.

* Screenlock - the unlock scheme application on Android
* Experiments -  experimental code and dataset
