# Unlcok-mobile-screen-using-handwritten-graphics
This is my master's thesis project. It proposes a scheme of unlocking the mobile phone screen using handwritten graphics (signature), including a mobile app and several experiments (datasets and codes).

## This folder contains two items. One is the unlock scheme application on Android, in the Sceenlock folder. The other is the experimental code, placed in the Verfication folder.
