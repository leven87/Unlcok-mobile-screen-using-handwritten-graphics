#The code for experiments

- **code**.  A folder where backup codes are stored. Some of them were used for testing, but they were not adopted in the final version.
- **dataset**. The datasets used in the experiments£º SUSIG, MOBISIG, SCD.
- **output**. The dataset used by the program and outputs when predicting the forgery difficulty level.
- **reference**. Some references code for coding.
- **toolbox_02450**. Contains some machine learning functions.
- **analysis.ipynb, analysis_mobile.ipynb**. Preprocessing, calculation and visualization experiments on a single sample.
- **complexity.ipynb, complexity_mobisig,ipynb**. Code of forgery difficulty level prediction for SUSIG and MOBISIG
- **decisiontree.py**. functions code of decision tree
- **EER.ipynb**. Draw ROC curve
- **evaluate.ipynb, evaluate-mobile.ipynb, evaluate-mobisig.ipynb**. Code of improved DTW-based algorithm and experiments on SUSIG, MOBISIG and SCD.
